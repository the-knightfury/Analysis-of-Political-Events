Suspecting the role of villagers in tipping off Police about their movements last month which led to an encounter at Bijapur area on September 15, Maoists abducted a few of them, including a village guard of Salpang, the Police claimed. Kalahandi Superintendent of Police (SP), Brijesh Rai said antiMaoist forces have rushed to the spot but there has been no further information. The abduction came just hours after a joint operation by Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Odisha Police on the border between the States that killed 28 ultras, including three top cadres on October 24."
