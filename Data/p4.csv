The suspected PLFI cadres then took them away into the deep forests and shot them from point blank range. Preliminary investigations suggest that the assailants used a .315 bore rifle to pump as many as three bullets into each of them. According to local villagers, Singh was a small time mahua seller and Kerketta used to work for him.
