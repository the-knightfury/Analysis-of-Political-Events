Bhatkal resident Ismail Abdul Rauf’s interrogation has given leads to investigators on missing links that could be a part of the large puzzle, including the alleged Islamic State (IS) fighter Shafi Armar alias Yousuf al Hindi, and how he purportedly funded to raise an Indian affiliated jihadi group through Dubai.Known as the centre of money laundering or hawala operations, Dubai, along with other countries in the Gulf region, houses a large Indian diaspora. Importantly, various armed groups, including the IS, in the ongoing conflict in Syria are funded through a network of private donations, collected from sheikhs, tribal leaders, influential ulemas and Arab diaspora based in Gulf countries. These two factors could be a starting point in unraveling the funding of Junood al Khalifa e Hind group outside the Indian territory by the Indians living in Gulf.Rauf had earlier travelled to Dubai 10 months ago to work as a labourer and came into contact with another Bhatkal resident, Ismail Nanda. During the time of their acquaintance, Nanda asked Rauf if he knew any hawala operators in Dubai and the latter gave contact of an operator, Abdullah Umaid. Officials investigating the case said Rauf was later contacted by Nanda and asked to check if Nadeem (code name for Sheikh’s hawala transaction) got the money. Rauf did not know who Mudabbir Sheikh was but it is believed that Nanda used the hawala operator in Dubai, suggested by Rauf, to make the transaction. Rauf was earlier a suspect in the case, but National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now made him a witness and is verifying the information provided by him. The agency is also making use of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) with Dubai to dig deep into Nanda s identity and find if he facilitated the hawala transactions to India at the behest of al Hindi or any other IS leader. If substantiated, it will take the investigation closer to proving that al Hindi used the IS group’s funds collected illegally by smuggling and selling oil, antiquities, collecting taxes from population living in its territory, ransom and selling Yezidi women as slaves among other methods to raise a module in India.",['NotSpecified'],['NotSpecified'],['NotSpecified']

Given this reason, the UNC posited its earlier stand that the State Government’s concern is “limited only to the valley people and not the indigenous tribal people”.The UNC stated that the tribal people of the State will oppose any Bill that would affect the hill areas unless the Manipur Assembly is democratised. “How can we expect any Bill passed in Manipur Assembly to be democratic when the tribal representatives are under represented against the Constitutional guideline of Article 332 ?” it questioned. According to the UNC, the root cause of many problems in the State lies in the “fact that the value of one valley vote is equivalent to 3 tribal votes”. The UNC demanded that the Government of India addresses “this critical issue” in order to achieve its goal for lasting peace and development in the region. The UNC also expressed its apprehension that the indigenous tribal people will continue to be “suppressed and will be further marginalised” despite Constitutional safeguard such as Article 371 C, Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hills Areas Committee) Order 1972, Manipur Autonomous District Council Act 1971 Reservation Rule etc. if the above pressing issue is not addressed or resolved. “",['NotSpecified'],['NotSpecified'],['NotSpecified']
